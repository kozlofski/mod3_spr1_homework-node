## module 3 sprint 1 homework

This simple application shows usage of basic Node modules.

You can display your system's info by choosing option `1`.

Under option `2` you will have an opportunity to parse a valid URL and split it to separate parts, like protocol, port, path, host name, etc. You can parse a url from command line (by running this script with url as an argument), providing manually your own when application running, or parse an example url. Parsing function demands url with protocol (e.g. "https://example.com").

Finally, under option `3`, you can hash a password with sha-256 algorithm. You can optionally provide salt, which makes hashing even more secure.

Exit is possible by typing `exit`

Run application by running script:

`npm run dev [optional URL to parse]`

or by running:

`node app.js [optional URL to parse]`

Enjoy ;)
